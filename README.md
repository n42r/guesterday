# Guestrrday 

Guestrrday is a toolbox for pop music historians and collectors. These tool have helped sort-out and organize more than 50,000 songs so far.

## Description

The pop music historian's dream: given a directory of music tracks guess the year of release and the label (!) of each and rename accordingly (meant to be used for 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s singles, but generally works with everything). It adds the (Label, Year) to the end of the filename (ex. "05. Ike & Tina Turner - A Love Like Yours (Don't Come Knocking Everyday).flac" becomes => "05. Ike & Tina Turner - A Love Like Yours (Don't Come Knocking Everyday) (London American, 1966).flac". The script queries discogs and google and includes several tricks to guess a good estimate of the year of release.

## About

I have been working on this project on and off in my free time for about 4 years. It was intended for my personal use and for friends. However, I recently realized that these tools have been quite useful over time, so I decided to prepare them for release, I plan to clean it up further in time.

## Contribution

Looking forward to find like-minded collaborators passionate about similar subjects.
