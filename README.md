# ROELD

ROELD is a toolbox for pop music historians and collectors. These tool have helped sort-out and organize more than 50,000 songs so far.

## Toolbox

It includes several tools:

- *Guess Release Date*: The pop music historian's dream: given a directory of music tracks guess the year of release and the label (!) of each and rename accordingly (meant to be used for 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s singles, but generally works with everything). It adds the (Label, Year) to the end of the filename (ex. "05. Ike & Tina Turner - A Love Like Yours (Don't Come Knocking Everyday).flac" becomes => "05. Ike & Tina Turner - A Love Like Yours (Don't Come Knocking Everyday) (London American, 1966).flac". The script queries discogs and google and includes several tricks to guess a good estimate of the year of release.
- generate a youtube playlist from a tracklist (forthcoming)
- get the list all remixes of an DJ/producer (forthcoming)
- and others...

## About

I have been working on this project on and off in my free time for about 4 years. It was intended for my personal use and for friends. However, I recently realized that these tools have been quite useful over time, so I decided to prepare them for release. Overall there are about 5-7 (depending how you count) tools and scripts that I regularly use. I already added one (guess year and label of music tracks), and I plan to clean it up further and to add the others in time.
